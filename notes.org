#+title: Computational Neuroscience

#+begin_quote
Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for characterizing /what/
nerovous systems do, determining /how/ the function and understanding /why/ they
operate in particular ways.

This definition plays nicely with the three types of computational models
(explained below) used in the field:
+ what :: descriptive models
+ how :: mechanistic models
+ why ::  interpretive models

* Computational models
+ Descriptive: how neurons respond to external stimuli; *neuron encoding model.*
  On the counterpart, we find decoding: extract information from neurons; useful
  in areas such as BCIs
+ Mechanistic Models: how can we simulate the behaviour of a single neuron or
  networks of neurons.
+ Interpretive (or Normative) models: why brain circuits operate the way they
  do?; what are the computational principles underlying their operation?

* Receptive fields
It refers to the *Specific properties* of a given sensory stimulus that generate
a strong response from a given cell. In more common words, the receptive field
refers to the type of features of a stimulus that excite a neuron.

An example of a receptive field is, on a visual task, a spot of light turned on
at a particular location on the retina.
** Descriptive model of Receptive Fields
Following with our example on visual tasks, a descriptive model must tell what
are the neurons responding to. For example, in the Retina, there are cells that
respond to light, but they can react in different ways: by exciting when light
is pointed to the center region of the neuron or when light is turned off on its
surrodings (/On-center Off-surround receptive field/); the opposite is also
found, i.e., /Off-center On-surround/, here, the cell is excited either when
light is turned off at its center region, or when light is turned on at its
surrodings. This kind of receptive fields are somewhat analogous to convolution
kernels in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in the sense that they are
filters.

Additionally, the retina is connected to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)
and, subsequently to the *Primary Visual Cortex (V1)*.
